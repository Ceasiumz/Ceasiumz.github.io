### II.1 nine Loong disks
1. Attractions(Cultural settings)
	- Game sets its cultural background at 9th decade of HongKong, highlights external prosperity while internal decay of HongKong that time. Game scenes show rich material life(luxury goods) and sharp mental problems(drags, gangsters)
	- Game through the cultural collision between the east and west to deepen its inside expression. The two protagonists are Chinese traditional Daoist(FengShuiShi), and Western detective(policeman). Their interactivities bursts more complex attraction elements.
2. Expansibility(Stories and Endings)
	- Game have many corresponding clues, which may be combined with each other through different orders and triggers. These countless combinations lead to countless endings and possibilities for story development for developers to supplement.
3. prospects(interactive novel)
	- Game can be seen as one form of interactive novel illustrated in hand drawn art style. Due to very limited interactivity(innovation) aside from pure narrative design, It should be hard for this game to attract complicated player community. But still can be success if with outstanding story lines and characters.
