# Chapter I, Household
## I.1. Respect Her Like Guest
![[Project (20251023071244) 1.jpg]]

	That was the year I started having secrets, I get married, but never aroused sexual impulse. They all say I fell in love with the woman in red bodycon dress at first sight — what a joke. I'm not the kind of person who would entrust my life to a superficial appearance, there was a concrete barrier when I was confronting her elaborated face. 
	
	She attempted to stretch her neck across a hole to catch my eyes, and failed.
	
	The reason I married her was my deeply buried fetish—a secret that could socially cripple a man. To conceal it, I chose to drag out a semblance of life with her. As for her feelings? I couldn't bring myself to care. Fortunately, she also cheat on me in this perfect house-like object.
## I.2. Goddess Waged Fortress Besieged 
![[项目 (20251028115231).jpg]]

	Rumours have it, elusive as catching the wind or grasping at shadows, that she is a fallen red duchess. I didn't believe it at first, but the innate pride etched into her very bones seemed to tame me subtly and imperceptibly. That gaze, originating from a place of authority, reflects back and forth within this household and, endowed with a sort of privilege even in physics, never diminishes. I live under a perpetual sense of surveillance. She has inlaid an exquisite collar around my neck, tethering me to her slender waist by a smooth white ribbon, swaying me back and forth until I hallucinate on the verge of suffocation. 
	Of course I know this condition: it's called "High-Pressure Syndrome." 
	I've fallen in love with her. 
	In my delusions, she resembles a celestial being, bringing to life the first poem my mom ever taught me: _"Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—Who is dancing, waving this coloured ribbon against the sky?"_ 
	Leaders always play with ribbons , that is seductive, banishing people towards the abyss of conquest
	
## I.3. Cup Bow Shadow Snack
![[Project (20251023073440) 1.jpg]]

	Late one night I sleep back to her, during yet another encounter where I felt inadequate, I drifted into a hazy, weightless dream. I recalled the day of our blind date, and it came back to me—we were both wearing handcuffs. My dear wife was because her father had lost his freedom due to corruption, and I, because of impotence. 
	In her wine glass, I saw a stick insect. It was an incredibly beautiful creature, its upright body carved with mundane patterns, its slender limbs stretching out in the pink wine. 
	It was a little sprite representing perfect evasion, singing loudly within the cup of desire. It said to me: "Become a my cryptozoologist. This is your only mission. Abandon all the relationships you've ever established in this society. I will wrap your soul with my cautious three pairs of legs. They are fragile, but surely stronger than you are.

# Chapter II, Dissolution
## II.1. Red Tie Farewell Duchess 
![[Project (20251023014250) 1.jpg]]

	On that cool, drizzly night, the Duchess of the red ribbon took to the skies aboard a glider crafted from pentagonal red scarves, tethering me beneath it with an iron chain. Before departure, I asked him dazedly where we were headed, yet he responded with his characteristically unquestionable silence.
	A fierce wind howled past, and the shackles binding me snapped with a sound that was lost in the gale. I began to fall from the immense height, my mind still shrouded in a daze. Yet, through my blurred vision, I could still make out a red triangular scarf fluttering past my eyes—a piece of crimson cloth shimmering with a fleeting light. To me, this cloth should be the king of crimson, yet it proved not as honest as its colour suggested. 
	For all its seemingly masculine vigour, it fell as helplessly as I did.
	
## II.2. Veiling With One Leaf
![[项目 (20251023035301).jpg]]

	The stick insect, upon waking, would typically emit a series of crackling sounds to stretch its body. This time, however, it could not, for its world was utterly dominated by a red ribbon before its eyes. It could only wait helplessly for what might come. The stick insect did not lie to me—it was indeed as fragile as it had told me.
## II.3. Gone With The Wind
![[项目 (20251028013507).jpg]]

	All the while, my body hovered in the sky like a balloon. It wasn't until my limbs began to dissociate that I realized I was hung upon a cross. It appeared sacred, and was also of a vivid red, like that triangular scarf. Strangely, even though I couldn't mobilize any of my senses, the smell of alcohol still transmitted clearly into my mind.
	
# Chapter III, Nihilism
## III.1. Glasses Clinking Liquor Splashing
![[项目 (20251028122915).jpg]]

	And so I moved into this sacred abode. From the day I stepped in, it seemed to fulfil my self-destructive desires without limit. Pink walls and pink floors made it impossible for me to distinguish direction.
	
	Maybe after hundreds of days, at least a few. I drowned myself in drink within those walls, until the floor was stained the exact same shade by pink-tinted wine. Only then did I realize countless others before me had done the same.
	Otherwise, this house, once as life-rich as a womb, could never have worn such a face of decay.
	
## III.2. As Expert of Alcoholism
![[Project (20251023024403) 1.jpg]]

	The sole window of this house was sealed with cement. Within these walls, there is no sense of time, no sense of space; no nature, no society. Here, I revel in the joy of escape. My once-failed life was utterly written off over these few nights. From then on, I feel no pain, I only feel emptiness. I finally no longer love the woman in red. 
	I can stay here until my bones rot in alcohol.
	
## III.3. Cement Seal Flesh Sprout
![[Project (20251023025057) 1.jpg]]

	Yet things always go contrary to one's wishes. Before I had squandered the last of my vitality, a desiccated object probed its way in—a small, reddish-brown stick. After that, whenever I lifted my head, I would find more of these sticks, with a yellowish head vaguely looming among them. However, the sealed window only permitted it to peer in with its head tilted, its three eyes—large, medium, and small—fixed intently upon me. 
	In a thin, girlish voice, it said, "Just come away with me like this. Stay with me for all my life
# Chapter IV, Runaway
## IV.1. Along Gravity To Vitality
![[Project (20251023120325) 1.jpg]]

	I gave a soft acknowledgment. Suddenly, the scene around me collapsed entirely. Gravity pulled me deep into a multi-coloured sea. I understood abruptly that if I wanted nirvana, I must swim ashore from these waters. 
	My limbs grew long and powerful, swimming on until the sea turned blue. Then, a colossal wave compressed my insides until they were as thin as a butterfly's wings
## IV.2.  Dizzy Seer Draft Cheer
![[Project (20251023112956) 1.jpg]]

	Once only knew the term "High-Pressure Syndrome" in theory, but now I have lived through it. It is a profoundly disorienting pressure—unlike the red-clad woman's searing authority that scorched my dignity, this one merely tortures the body, nothing more. 
	I squeezed out the last traces of alcohol from my alveoli along with the seawater, filled a wine glass with it, raised it high, then set it down gently.
## IV.3.  I Will Find You
![[Project (20251023113245) 1.jpg]]

	I poured this glass of wine into the sea. As the wine soaked completely into the ocean, numerous stick insects emerged from the seawater. They contorted their bodies, spelling out a phrase. _'un jour je serai de retour pres de toi'._ (I should come to your side some day) The scorching sun ignited the alcohol on the sea, and a pinkish mist began to rise slowly.
	She spoken to me, as if she can accept my helpless, and send these stick insectts to confess to me. Crypozoologist is actually her husband.
# Chapter V, Fusion
## V.1. Smell Like Baby Spirit
![[Project (20251023125813) 1.jpg]]

	I recognized the stick insect from my dream at first glance. Its body was fragile, its head cunning. Using its own tension, it drew the entire ocean together, then bowed its head gently to me. Finally, I saw the stick insect in its entirety. On either side of its cheeks were three eyes each—not too many, nor too few, I thought to myself.
	It so cute that I treat it as my baby. I smelled we will accomplish the process of breeding life and send our baby's spirit into this stick, fragile and complete.
## V.2. It Is My Momma
![[Project (20251023124308) 1.jpg]]

	The girlish voice spoke again: "Are you ready to become a cryptozoologist?" 
	Still unable to speak, I could only sit gently on its headplate and tap my foot. I then turned to look at the highlight in its eyes, and within that gleam flashed the pale face of a neurasthenic man. A wave of shame burned through me fiercely, reminding me of the helpless awkwardness I felt in front of my mother. Only then did I remember my true secret: seeing myself reflected in my mother's eyes was my greatest terror.
## V.3. Look Into My Eyes
![[项目 (20251028112834).jpg]]

	That was also what I had seen in the eyes of the woman in red. I tried not to imagine every woman I saw as my mother, yet I still failed. That primal authority of procreation stripped me of all free will. 
	The little girl's voice emerged again from the stick insect's mouthparts: "Look into my eyes."
# Chapter VI, Apotheosis
## VI.I. The Heart Of Wild
![[Project (20251023111017) 1.jpg]]

	I gently slid down from its body and gazed at it. It led me to a patch of reeds by the beach, and I kept looking into its eyes. 
	The pupils occupied three-fourths of its eyes—so harmonious, it brought me peace.
## VI.2. Le Coup De Grâce
![[Project (20251023062604) 1.jpg]]

	The stick insect crouched by the edge of the grass and whispered, "Upon you, there remains one last glass of wine. It is an alluring pink, more intense than any cup you have ever raised. Offer it to me now, Mr. Cryptozoologist.
	I was astonished. Every drop of wine had been wrung from each inch of my skin, every muscle; alcohol had finally released me. "It's that pink, soft flesh," the stick insect said with a laugh, using two legs tipped with barbs to part my chest. 
	I looked down and saw that my heart had turned a tender pink, lifting it out and offered it to the stick insect. "So graceful am I, in blue, beyond the duchess in red "
## VI.3.  Author Inferred Power Transferred
![[项目 (20251028111207).jpg]]

	"Is this red triangular scarf something you abandoned here?" it asked me. 
	I nodded subconsciously, feeling certain I had seen it somewhere before. It wasn't until the stick insect fully unfurled it that I realized—this was the very same scarf born with me from the red parachute.
	
## VI.4. Crescent Mark Crusade Mask
![[Project (20251023023706) 1.jpg]]

	I accepted the stick insect's return gift and used it to cover my sparse beard and pale lips. At that moment, all my self-negation vanished. This red triangular scarf concealed all of my body, the good and the bad alike.
	The stick insect asked once more, "Are you ready to be my cryptozoologist?" 
	This time, I shook my head firmly, "I should be her husband".
	I said I would take its eyes instead—among its six eyes. "There must always be one watching me, monitor me, manipulate me"
	 It rubbed its hands together melancholically, turned, and left. I did the same. It looked back at me once more, but I did not. I felt a perfect brown sphere infused to the middle of own eyes, fading to a crescent mark on forehead.
	 I understood that having lost my heart, I would die tonight. There's only thing I can do.
	 To use this red mask to shroud myself and seek out the woman in red, to retrieve what was never originally hers.
